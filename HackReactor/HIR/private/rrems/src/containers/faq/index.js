              <h5><b>Q: What should I do if student raise any red flags - rude and agressive, lack of growth mindset, etc..?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Immediately notify the admissions manager (now @joshshaman) who will help you take make any further decisions.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: What should I do if I don’t hear back from a student?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Send a follow up email and If you still don’t hear back from a student, notify the admissions associate (now @angelinadavis) who will take over from there.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: What if my student has already been accepted to Hack Reactor?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Verify their acceptance on Pipedrive and with the admissions associate (@angelinadavis).  Don’t meet with a student who has been accepted.
                </p>
              <p>Note:  All admissions decision information should come from the admissions team. If a student is listed in Pipedrive as being accepted, the decision may not have been sent out to them yet.</p>

              <h5><b>Q: One of my students is looking to apply early because he is afraid of the seats filling up for the remote class. Is the class filling up something the PTC students need to worry about if they put off interviewing?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Our cap is high so I wouldn't worry much about that - messaging to student should be: “The greater concern is to take the interview before you are ready.”</p>
            </div>
            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: One of my students has an interview scheduled too soon, what should I recommend?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Recommend that they do personal tech coaching first. There's no harm in them waiting until a few days before the cohort interview cutoff date. If they miss the cutoff date even, it’s better than getting locked out because they are unprepared and didn’t commit enough time to studying.</p>

            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: I have a student who is currently locked out of interviewing. Can I still teach them?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Students who are locked out can interview before the lockout IF they do coaching and the HiR says they are good to go.  This HiR recommendation voids any project requirement, but should only be given if the student has made significant progress and is technically prepared for the interview.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: What should I do with my student who wants to interview at the beginning of coaching rather than the end?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: One goal of the PTC program is avoid using TI time wastefully. The preference is that 
students would take coaching first to increase their chance of getting an accept. However; if a student is really set on taking the interview early, that is their choice. In the future, PTC will be more queue-based so a student would lose their spot in the queue and move down and have to wait longer for coaching.</p>

            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: Should I encourage my students to form a study group?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: If they are interested, group learning tends to be helpful and motivating. However, this is certainly not a requirement.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="card-panel">
              <h5><b>Q: Are students currently enrolled in “Fulcrum” eligible for PTC?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <p>A: Students should not do both fulcrum and PTC so they should opt-out of PTC and stick with Fulcrum. Or if they just registered for Fulcrum and changed their mind (ex. same day or next day), they can try to connect with Fulcrum to see if they can get a refund. Check the student’s Pipedrive too so you can estimate their preparedness for either program.</p>

              <h5><b>Q: What responsibilities do I have once the coaching sessions end?</b></h5>
              <hr />
              <ul>
                A: If you are recommending the student interview at the end of your coaching:
                <li>- Have them sign up for an interview very soon after they are done coaching</li>
                <li>- Get the date, and then check in and track whether they are accepted.</li>
                <li>- Record metrics </li>
                <li>- Add notes to Pipedrive</li>
