    <h5>Hey [student]</h5>

    <p>
    I'm [yourName], currently a Hacker-in-Residence at Hack Reactor Remote. I’m contacting you because you’ve enrolled in the Personal Tech Coaching program. Let’s work out a schedule and get started!

      <br />
      <br />
    Let me know what is best time for you this week. I have slot  at [ **6.30pm–7–30pm CST this Wednesday or Tuesday** ]. For your reference, we’ll meet for 45–60 minutes twice a week.
      <br />
      <br />


    A little bit about me and what I do here: as an HiR I've been [on an engineering team, teach remote prep classes, do this coaching, help with outcomes, run a help desk, do technical interviews, etc]; I've been into tech/programming since [1967 but had been away from it for a few years - some tech background]; I like [jazz, penguins, and travel - some non-tech background].

     <br />
     <br />
    Reply to me here ( [first.last]@hackreactor.com ) and let me know what time works for you this week - [restate_someTime], and if you've got any other questions or scheduling concerns.

    <br/>
    <br/>
            Thanks!
